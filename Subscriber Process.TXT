If not already subscribed, generate new subsriber files:
python mediacopier.py --name whatever init both
Now - delete any movies from the subscriber list you want to copy in the inital batch
And mark any TV shows you want to subscribe as Showname|1|0

Create a folder in the history folder with the name
Copy a 'Finish Movies.bat' & 'Finish TV.bat'
Edit with appropriate paths

If already subscribed:
Run UpdateName.bat to kick it off
When finished, or if issues, you can run again (you will have to answer the questions again though).
It will only copy new things.
However, you can run 'Finish Movies' or 'Finish TV' at any point to update the subscriber files of course.
