At the moment the movies works for me ok.

I have broken the passing of 'seen movies' into set_up_new_person (and commented out the creation of the list in xbmc_agogo)

Should fix such that:
1. If a movies config file exists, that is used
2. If not, then get seen movies from the xbmc source & create on the fly one from this

If (1) a results file is written (currently works)
If (2) delete on the fly one at the end.


Also - why does the Profit get copied - it's been watched, so shouldn't?
